<h2>What it does</h2>
The app works in two parts. 
<ol>
  <li><b>Gamification Functionality:</b> The web extension that helps the user log in and record their session to track their progress. Once the user has logged in, they get to select their ‘mission’. A ‘mission’ is the gamification of the Pomodoro technique, where a player selects a certain amount of time to study and gets the reward in XP and Credits. These are to be collected for later purchase.</li>

  </p>
  <li><b>Distraction Detection Functionality:</b> During a ‘mission’, the web extension tracks what the user is using their web browser for. If it detects that it is for unproductive purposes, then it blocks the user from entering the website, reminding them that they should be studying. It also sends out a message to everyone else on the server so they can hold their friend accountable.
